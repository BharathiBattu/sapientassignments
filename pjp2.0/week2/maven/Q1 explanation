Each phase is a sequence of goals, and each goal is responsible for a specific task.
We can list all goals bound to a specific phase and their plugins using the command:

mvn help:describe -Dcmd=PHASENAME

For example, to list all goals bound to the compile phase, we can run:

mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile

A Maven plugin is a group of goals. However, these goals aren't necessarily all bound to the same phase.
We can use the following command to list all goals in a specific plugin:

mvn <PLUGIN>:help
